Coding Theory
-> Cryptography, Error correcting codes, Data compression

### Coding
#### Source Alphabet
S = {s_1 ... s_n}
S^t = inf U lambda(cartesian product)) = 1 S^lambda = set of words of length lambda "over" S
- over A: composed of alphabet A
^ set of all non-empty finite words over S
Ex: S = {a, b, c}
S^2 = {aa, ab, ac, ba, ...}

#### Code Alphabet
A = {a_1 ... a_n}
For some reason we want to represent words over S by words over A
"Encoding function (phi): S^t -> A^t"
w = phi(u), w is "code representative" of u

#### Historical Examples
- Smoke signals (encoded msgs)
- Semaphore
	- way sending a message from one ship to another
	- moving two flags to represent letters
- telegraph
	- Short space between letters, longer space between words
	- S = {a,b,c...}, A = {., -, short pause, longer pause}


In almost all of this course, A = {0, 1}
Chapter 9, A = ASCII symbol set
