# Job Control Language (JCL)
1. Special types of programming languages used to provide instructions to use
2. What compiler to use?
3. What data to use?
For each job, specify job type (compute, i/o), memory, disk, etc.

# Multiprogramming

- There must be enough memory to hold the OS (resident monitor) and 1 user program
- When 1 job needs to wait for IO, the processor can switch to an IO-independent job
- Time sharing systems (aka "servers")
	- Needs to handle multiple interactive jobs
	- Processor time is shared among multiple users
	- Multiple users simultaneously access system through terminals, OS interleaving each execution
