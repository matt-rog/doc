# Length and Dot Product in $R^n$
### Length of a vector
For vector $v=(a,b,c)$, the length/magnitude (written as $||v||$) is calculated as $\sqrt{a^2+b^2+c^2}$

### Arithmetic
$||v+u||=\sqrt{(v+u)^2}$
* V and U are orthogonal IFF ||v+u|| = ||v|| + ||u||
* (Pythagorean theorem)
##### Distance
d(v,u) = same as addition

## Dot Product
v x u = dot product of u and v
- multiply each element i of u and v, add these products together

### Angle Between Vectors
1. $|cos\theta|=\frac{u \cdot v}{||u|| ||v||}$
