# Inner Product Spaces
## Orthogonal Projection


## Orthogonal and Orthonormal Sets
- A set of vectors in an inner product space V is **orthogonal** when every pair of vectors in S is orthogonal (=0)
- If every vector in set is unit vector (magnitude of 1), then S is **orthonormal**

#### Orthogonal Sets Are Linearly Independent
