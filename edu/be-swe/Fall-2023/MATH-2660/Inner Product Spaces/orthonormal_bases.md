# Orthonormal Bases | Gram-Schmidt Process
## Orthogonal and Orthonormal Sets
- A set of vectors in an inner product space V is **orthogonal** when every pair of vectors in S is orthogonal (=0)
- If every vector in set is unit vector (magnitude of 1), then S is **orthonormal**

#### Orthogonal Sets Are Linearly Independent

## Coordinates Relative to an Orthonormal Basis
If B={v,v,v,v...} is an orthonormal basis for an inner product space V, then the coordinate representation of vector W relative to B is
- w=<w,v>v + <w,v>v +<w,v>v .....
