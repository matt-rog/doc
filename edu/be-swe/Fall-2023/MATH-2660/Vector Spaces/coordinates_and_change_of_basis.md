# Coordinates and Change of Basis
## 1. Coordinate Representation in $R^{n}$
- Let B be some ordered basis for vector space V, and x be a vector in V s.t.
	- x=cv+....+cv
- The c scalars are the coordinates of x relative to the bases B
- The coordinate matrix of x relative to B is the column matrix in R^n whose components are coordinates of x
1. Find standard basis for R^n
2. Find the coefficients for the standard basis s.t. the result is the target matrix
3. Take these coefficients into a column matrix => coordinate matrix
