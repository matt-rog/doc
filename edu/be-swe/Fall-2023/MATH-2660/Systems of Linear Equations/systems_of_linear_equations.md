# Systems of Linear Equations

### Def: Linear Equation in *n* variables
A linear equation in *n* variables $x_1,x_2, ... x_n$ has form:
	$a_1x_1 + a_2x_2 + ... + a_nx_n = b$
* Coefficients $a_1 \to a_n$ are real numbers
* Constant term b is a real number
* $a_1$: leading coefficient, $x_1$: leading variable

### System of Linear Systems
- A system of *m* linear systems is a set of *m* linear equations with *n* variables
Number of solutions (only one can be true):
1. The sys has 1 soln (consistent system)
2. The sys has $\infty$ soln (consistent system)
3. The sys has no solution (inconsistent)

### Def: Row-Echelon Form
"Stair-step" pattern with leading coefficient of 1
e.g. $\begin{cases}x-2y+3z=9\\y+3z=5\\z=2\end{cases}$

### Operations that Produce Equivalent Systems
1. Interchange 2 equations
2. Multiply an equation by a nonzero constant
3. Add a multiple of an equation to another equation
