* Addition, scalar multiplication are the **same** as real numbers
* Matrix multiplication is the **same** as real numbers as long as the order of the matrix is not changed

## Transpose of a Matrix
### Properties of Transpose
1. $(A^T)^T=A$
2. $(A+B)^T=A^T+B^T$
3. $(cA)^T=c(A^T)$
4. $(AB)^T = B^TA^T$
