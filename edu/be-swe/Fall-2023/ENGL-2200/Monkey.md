# Journey to the West

## Ch 1, 2 DQ
1. How does the monkeys’ behavior evolve on pp. 4-7. What traits characterize their behavior in these early stages? What points might the author be suggesting through any of the changes that he depicts?  
2. Why does the Monkey King become sad? Describe the journey that he plans to undertake and the objective of his quest. Characterize his initial mindset.

4. What sorts of behaviors do members of the Patriarch’s congregation attempt to teach the Monkey King early in his time with them? What does the Patriarch’s initial lecture before the Monkey King focus upon, and how does the Monkey respond to the lecture (19-20)? Why might the details that you note for these answers be thematically significant?

What traits most strongly characterize the Monkey King as a disciple of the Patriarch (22-24)? Speculate on their potential allegorical significance of significant details in this section.

## Ch 14, 15, 29, 30, 31  
Try to develop an interpretation of the most important dimensions of the  
chapter of the text assigned to your group. Consider factors such as  
1. possible allegorical meanings of any relevant features of the chapter; how any details or assumptions about “the good life” relate to teachings in the Buddhist texts that we read for this class;
2. what overall “lessons” Wu Ch’eng-en seems to imply through any aspects of this chapter; and how any details or lessons might resonate in interesting ways with either other early religious texts that you know or other works of classical, medieval, or Renaissance literature that you have read.  
3. What images, events, or quotes in this chapter did members of your group find most interesting or consider most important? How do aspects of the journey or quest undertaken by these characters seem similar to or different from the other journeys and quests that we have considered this  semester?  
Obviously, not all questions will be relevant for all chapters, but answer as many  
of the questions as you can, starting with the ones that members of your group  
consider most interesting or important to the section assigned to your group.
