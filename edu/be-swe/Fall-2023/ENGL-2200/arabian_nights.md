What relationships do you see between the later story of the jinni and the girl in the underground bunker (114-19) and both of the stories mentioned in the previous? Do your see any shared themes?  
	1. **AAA**
2. What characteristics of the good society seem implied on pages 90-97?  
3. What seems to be the porter’s initial view of the good life (80-90)? Why do you think that the authors included the “guess-the-name” drinking game (88-91)?  
4. What overall themes do you see in the first dervish’s tale (104-11)? What purposes might it serve? What relationships do you see between the first dervish’s tale and (a) the story of  the porter and the three ladies (80-90) and (b) the frame situation (the “Prologue” or opening of the collection)?  
5. What overall purposes do you see for the second dervish’s tale (108-22, but you can leave the inset tale on 122-26 to group 6)? What relationships do you see between the second dervish’s tale and the frame situation (the “Prologue” or opening of the collection)?  
6. What overall purposes do you see for the tale of the envied and the envious (122-26), a tale embedded within the second dervish’s tale, which is embedded within the tale of the porter  and the three ladies, which is embedded within the overall frame-tale narrative, the Arabian Nights)? Do you notice any interesting themes or images? Why does the second dervish choose to share this tale in this particular context, to this particular audience? What relationships do you see between the tale of the envied and the envious and the frame situation (the “Prologue” or opening of the collection)?  
7. The tales of the three dervishes all include descriptions of an underground bunker (104-5 and 108-9, 114-18; and 141-45). What similarities do you see among the three tales? Does an underground setting seem to hold any particular thematic significance for each tale? Explain. What relationships do you see among the three tales that share an underground setting? As context for the description of the third underground bunker mentioned above, Summarize the part of the third dervish’s tale that appears on pages 138-40.  
## Frame Q
1. Describe the brothers Shahrayar and Shahzaman as kings at the outset of the Arabian Nights (5). Do they rule effectively? Do their kingdoms seem to be presented as “good societies”?Explain and present brief evidence. How do Shahrayar and Shahzaman change as kings between pages 5 and 7? How do the societies over which they rule change? How do these brothers’ views of “the good life” change between pages 5 and 11?
	1. **They're nights & champions => good rulers over good society (bite to support bark)**
	2. **Generosity to family is important (emphasis of gifts between brothers**
	3. **Loyalty is important, but also you're living the good life if someone is living a worse life than you**
2. What view of “the good life” do you think would be suggested by the portrayal of Shahrazad (14-15? Note that Shahrazad will be the narrator of the tales that follow the Prologue (the  section that appears before Night 1). The Prologue, along with the conclusion (which we won’t read), provides the frame into which all of the other tales fit.]
