# Odyssey - Homer


Explain what Odysseus’ conversation (or attempted conversation) with the  
following shade(s) suggests about the view of the “good life” suggested by The Odyssey:
* Agamemnon: (lines 439-527)
	* Agamemnon (doesnt know Odysseus isnt dead) tells story of his death, blaming Aegisthus for the actual murder, very upset
	* complains about Atreus curse
	* basically just bashing women, dont trust your wife, test her, etc.
	* Penelope is cool tho!
* Achilles (lines 530-615)
	* Achilles says his son sucks and how he wants to be back on earth
	* even though he is the leader of the dead pretty much, he still hates he'd rather be a slave on earth
* Ajax (620-49)
	* furious @ Odysseus, because Odysseus was awarded Achilles'  armor when it really should've been him
	* interaction modeled after Dido

What do the descriptions that appear in lines 650-88 suggest about the views of “the good life” in Homer’s culture?
* This is an extreme view of the bad life, no one is looking forward to the afterlife
* Dramatic punishments for sinners, highlight what sins were thought to be awful
	* Tantalus - killed own son & tried to serve up to gods
	* ... Almost all disrespected the gods
