# The Threat Hunting Process

`Setting the Stage`: The initial phase is all about planning and preparation. It includes laying out clear targets based on a deep understanding of the threat landscape, our business's critical requirements, and our threat intelligence insights. The preparation phase also encompasses making certain our environment is ready for effective threat hunting, which might involve enabling extensive logging across our systems and ensuring threat hunting tools, such as SIEM, EDR, IDS, are correctly set up. Additionally, we stay informed about the most recent cyber threats and familiarize ourselves with threat actor profiles.

`Formulating Hypotheses`: The next step involves making educated predictions that will guide our threat hunting journey. These hypotheses can stem from various sources, like recent threat intelligence, industry updates, alerts from security tools, or even our professional intuition. We strive to make these hypotheses testable to guide us where to search and what to look for.

`Designing the Hunt`: Upon crafting a hypothesis, we need to develop a hunting strategy. This includes recognizing the specific data sources that need analysis, the methodologies and tools we'll use, and the particular indicators of compromise (IoCs) or patterns we'll hunt for. At this point, we might also create custom scripts or queries and utilize dedicated threat hunting tools.

`Data Gathering and Examination`: This phase is where the active threat hunt occurs. It involves collecting necessary data, such as log files, network traffic data, endpoint data, and then analyzing this data using the predetermined methodologies and tools. Our goal is to find evidence that either supports or refutes our initial hypothesis. This phase is highly iterative, possibly involving refinement of the hypothesis or the investigation approach as we uncover new information.

`Evaluating Findings and Testing Hypotheses`: After analyzing the data, we need to interpret the results. This could involve confirming or disproving the hypothesis, understanding the behavior of any detected threats, identifying affected systems, or determining the potential impact of the threat. This phase is crucial, as it will inform the next steps in terms of response and remediation.

`Mitigating Threats`: If we confirm a threat, we must undertake remediation actions. This could involve isolating affected systems, eliminating malware, patching vulnerabilities, or modifying configurations. Our goal is to eradicate the threat and limit any potential damage.

`After the Hunt`: Once the threat hunting cycle concludes, it's crucial to document and share the findings, methods, and outcomes. This might involve updating threat intelligence platforms, enhancing detection rules, refining incident response playbooks, or improving security policies. It's also vital to learn from each threat hunting mission to enhance future efforts.

`Continuous Learning and Enhancement`: Threat hunting is not a one-time task, but a continuous process of learning and refinement. Each threat hunting cycle should feed into the next, allowing for continuous improvement of hypotheses, methodologies, and tools based on the evolving threat landscape and the organization's changing risk profile.
