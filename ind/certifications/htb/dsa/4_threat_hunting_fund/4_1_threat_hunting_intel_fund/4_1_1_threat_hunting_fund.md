Threat hunting is an active, human-led, and often hypothesis-driven practice that systematically combs through network data to identify stealthy, advanced threats that evade existing security solutions.

## Threat Hunting Team

The ideal threat hunting team composition typically includes the following roles:

`Threat Hunter`: The core role within the team, threat hunters are cybersecurity professionals with a deep understanding of the threat landscape, cyber adversaries' Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs), and sophisticated threat detection methodologies. They proactively search for Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) and are proficient in using a variety of threat hunting tools and platforms.

`Threat Intelligence Analyst`: These individuals are responsible for gathering and analyzing data from a variety of sources, including open-source intelligence, dark web intelligence, industry reports, and threat feeds. Their job is to understand the current threat landscape and predict future trends, providing valuable insights to threat hunters.

`Incident Responders`: When threat hunters identify potential threats, incident responders step in to manage the situation. They investigate the incident thoroughly and they are also responsible for containment, eradication, and recovery actions, and they ensure that the organization can quickly resume normal operations.

`Forensics Experts`: These are the team members who delve deep into the technical details of an incident. They are proficient in digital forensics and incident response (DFIR), capable of analyzing malware, reverse engineering attacks, and providing detailed incident reports.

`Data Analysts/Scientists`: They play a pivotal role in examining large datasets, using statistical models, machine learning algorithms, and data mining techniques to uncover patterns, correlations, and trends that can lead to actionable insights for threat hunters.

`Security Engineers/Architects`: Security engineers are responsible for the overall design of the organization's security infrastructure. They ensure that all systems, applications, and networks are designed with security in mind, and they often work closely with threat hunters to implement tools and techniques that facilitate threat hunting, as well as kill-chain defenses.

`Network Security Analyst`: These professionals specialize in network behavior and traffic patterns. They understand the normal ebb and flow of network activity and can quickly identify anomalies indicative of a potential security breach.

`SOC Manager`: The Security Operations Center (SOC) manager oversees the operations of the threat hunting team, ensuring smooth coordination among team members and effective communication with the rest of the organization.
